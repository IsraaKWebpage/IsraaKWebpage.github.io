    <p>Potassium is a mineral and electrolyte. it is found in fruits and veggies such as bananas, avacado, cucumber, kiwi etc.
        It helps your muscles function, including the ones that make your heart beat. Any of the extra Potassium we have in our blood is removed from
        the blood via our kidneys and stores it for the next time you need it.</p>
